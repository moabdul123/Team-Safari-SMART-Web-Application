Hello and welcome to the SMART T1D Variant Catalogue Web Application

The SMART SNP Catalog is a web application that allows researchers to retrieve Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) data from chromosome 6, associated to type 1 diabetes (T1D). There are four search parameters the user can query to retrieve the data: rs-value, gene name, genomic location and/or co-ordinates, or region. Once queried this will return seven data points which are  presented on the website which are: SNP ID (rs:ID), genomic positions and/or location, p-value(s), mapped genes(s), variant allele frequency in 5 populations - African, American, East Asian, European and South Asian -  functional impact in the form of Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT)  and Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) scores and gene ontology.
